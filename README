NAME
    RT-Extension-QuoteSelection - Quotes selected text, if any, when
    replying/commenting to tickets

WHAT'S THIS DO?
    Highlight a snippet of text on the ticket display page and click a Reply
    or Comment link. *Voil√†!* Your highlighted text (and only your
    highlighted text) is quoted in the message box.

    Both the per-transaction Reply/Comment links and the Reply/Comment links
    under the Actions menu will use the selected text, if any.

CAVEATS
    User signatures aren't inserted when highlighted text is quoted.

    The per-transaction Reply/Comment links will consider your update a
    response to the transaction even if you quote from an entirely different
    transaction. This doesn't matter to most people, and only affects email
    threading.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::QuoteSelection));
